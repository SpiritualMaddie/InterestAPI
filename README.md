# InterestAPI
#### School Project - Labb3 ASP.NET API
Here I have created my first API, very simple for getting people, their interests and links to those interests.

Aswell as adding new interests and links to said people. 

There's more in the code for adding, editing and deleting people
plus more, it's just commented out to simplify it for the assignment.

In the gifs you can see the calls made with Swagger.
